# Progress Report - Operations and Maintenance 
At my current workplace, I developed an PowerBI Dashboard which showed all the analyzed data since the start of commissioning of our Overhead Gantry system. 

## Prerequisites:
- Volume reports shows how much volume in trays are stored into the machine (Infeeding) and retrieved/outfeed from machines (Outfeeding)
- Downtime reports shows downtime of machines in different formats
- The reports were targetted to audience with highly technical backgound (A different version was presented to stakeholders in PPT slides which can't be shared as confidentiality requirement)

## Task 1: 
- Find out the utilization rate (Infeeding vs Outfeeding) of each shift
- Average downtime in hours and count of failures

## Task 2: Performance of gantry system vs. performance of independent robots

## Tools used:
- Type of Data: Structured (Excel, SQL) & Unstructured (.log files from machines)
- Data Cleaning: Python, PowerQuery in PowerBI
- Visualizations: PowerBI


## Note:
- This report should not be used to judge my presentation abilities as this was the inital stage and the final presentation is highly confidential and can not be shared
